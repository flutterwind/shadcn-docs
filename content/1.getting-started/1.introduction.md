## What is shadcn-flutter?

**shadcn-flutter** brings the philosophy of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to Flutter. Instead of installing a rigid component library, you get beautifully designed, accessible components that you can copy, customize, and own.

Every component is styled using [Flutterwind](https://flutterwind.brighthustle.in) — a Tailwind CSS utility engine for Flutter — so you can tweak styles with familiar utility classes right in your Dart code.

## Why shadcn-flutter?

::card-group{cols=2}
  ::card{title="Beautiful by Default" icon="lucide:palette"}
  Components follow shadcn/ui's design language with proper theming, dark mode, and accessibility.
  ::

  ::card{title="Customizable" icon="lucide:settings"}
  Every component accepts a `className` prop for Flutterwind utility overrides.
  ::

  ::card{title="Variant-driven" icon="lucide:layers"}
  Buttons, badges, and more support `variant` and `size` props just like shadcn/ui.
  ::

  ::card{title="Powered by Flutterwind" icon="lucide:wind"}
  Interactive states like `hover:`, `focus-visible:`, `dark:` work out of the box.

## Philosophy

shadcn-flutter is **not** a traditional component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you integrate into your project. You have full control over the source code and can modify components to fit your needs.

```dart [example.dart]
ShadcnButton(
  variant: 'destructive',
  size: 'sm',
  className: 'rounded-full',
  onPressed: () {},
  child: Text('Delete'),
)
```
